## **Introduction**  
Access to clean water is a basic human right, but for millions in African communities, it remains a daily struggle. Hours spent queuing for water at shared taps, reliance on contaminated wells, and a lack of safe infrastructure have created a significant public health and social crisis.  

The **Maji Ndogo Project** was designed to analyze these challenges through data-driven approaches. Using simulated real-world data, this project aimed to understand the root causes of water access issues and propose practical, data-backed solutions to improve lives in underserved communities.  

This report documents the tools, methods, and insights from this project, initially developed during the **ALX Data Science Program** and recently enhanced with additional analysis and storytelling elements.  



## üéØ **Project Goals and Questions**  

This project was guided by key objectives to address critical water access challenges:  
1. Who are the most underserved populations in terms of water access?  
2. What are the primary factors contributing to long queue times and overcrowding?  
3. How does contamination of wells exacerbate water access issues?  
4. What is the relationship between water access points and crime rates?  
5. How can resources be optimally allocated to maximize the impact of improvements?
